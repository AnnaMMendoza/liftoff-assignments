## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to create a "What can I make" web app that the user gives specific ingredients they have in their home that they would like to make a meal out of. Limit 5 ( I am thinking for now). 
The app will search the Internet for recipes with those main ingredients (or only those ingredients was my original idea). It will return recipes found with those ingredients. The user can then opt to save them in their "recipe box" if they choose but must login to do so. 

### Features
1. login
2. Web search using APIs
3. Render Link or recipe
4. Save recipe on the site

### Technologies
1. JavaScript, jQuery
2. Vue.js

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn Vue and review both JavaScript & jQuery

### Project Tracker
Pivotal, Trello, or Github Projects, we only talked about one so I need to look at the other two now! 
I have an account on Pivotal Tracker and one with Trello. I prefer Trello's interface. Kinda confused wtih Pivotal's
Icebox stories and Iterations where you also add stories.
